# Deployment Summary - Scorecard Fix

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **Fixed `matchScorecard.ts`** - Added processing to populate missing `batTeam` and `totalRuns` fields in scorecard innings data
   - Calculates `totalRuns` from batsman array + extras
   - Determines `batTeam` based on innings number and match teams
   - This ensures scorecard displays properly on match details pages

### What This Fixes
- ✅ Scorecard innings now show team names (batTeam)
- ✅ Scorecard innings now show total runs (totalRuns)
- ✅ Match details page will display scores correctly
- ✅ MatchHeader component will show proper scores
- ✅ MatchScorecard component will display complete innings data

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/match/matchScorecard.ts`
- `backend/dist/controllers/match/matchScorecard.js` (compiled)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add backend/src/controllers/match/matchScorecard.ts
git add backend/dist/controllers/match/matchScorecard.js
git commit -m "fix: Add batTeam and totalRuns processing to scorecard data"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Vercel backend project:
- ✅ `RAPIDAPI_KEY` - Your current working API key
- ✅ `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- ✅ `RAPIDAPI_HOST` - cricbuzz-cricket.p.rapidapi.com
- ✅ All other RAPIDAPI_* URLs

### 3. Verify Frontend Environment Variables
Make sure this is set in your Vercel frontend project:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your backend URL (https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app)

### 4. Clear Cached Scorecard Data (Optional)
After deployment, you may want to clear cached scorecard data to force fresh fetches with the new processing:
- The new code will automatically process any newly fetched scorecards
- Existing cached scorecards will remain as-is until they're refreshed

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit a match details page: `https://your-frontend.vercel.app/matches/113670`
2. Check that:
   - Team scores show in the header (e.g., "634/9" and "286/10")
   - Scorecard tab displays innings with team names
   - Each innings shows: "Team Name Innings - Runs/Wickets (Overs)"

## Notes
- The fix processes scorecard data when it's fetched from the API and saved to the database
- This ensures all future scorecard fetches will have the correct structure
- No frontend changes needed - components already support these fields
