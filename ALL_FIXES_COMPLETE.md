---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST:

### Test Locally:
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Visit: http://localhost:3001
# Click on any match card
# Check:
# - Match card shows runs (e.g., "634/9")
# - Match details page shows runs in header
# - Scorecard shows innings totals with runs
```

### Check Browser Console:
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab

You should see debug logs like:
```
Match: 113670
Team1 Score: {runs: 634, wickets: 9, overs: 147.4}
Team2 Score: {runs: 286, wickets: 10, overs: 88.1}
extractTeamInfo - Team1 Score: {runs: 634, wickets: 9, overs: 147.4}
extractTeamInfo - Team2 Score: {runs: 286, wickets: 10, overs: 88.1}
Innings 1: {teamName: "Middlesex", totalRuns: 634, totalWickets: 9, totalOvers: 147.4}
```

---

## 📝 WHAT THE DATA LOOKS LIKE:

### Backend Response (from `/api/matches/recent`):
```json
{
  "matchId": "113670",
  "teams": [
    {
      "teamName": "Middlesex",
      "score": {
        "runs": 634,    ← RUNS ARE HERE!
        "wickets": 9,
        "overs": 147.4,
        "runRate": 4.29
      }
    },
    {
      "teamName": "Gloucestershire",
      "score": {
        "runs": 286,    ← RUNS ARE HERE!
        "wickets": 10,
        "overs": 88.1,
        "runRate": 3.24
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### How It Displays:

**Match Card:**
```
Middlesex          634/9 (147.4 ov)
Gloucestershire    286/10 (88.1 ov)
```

**Match Details Header:**
```
    MDX                VS              GLOUCS
   634/9                              286/10
(147.4 ov)                          (88.1 ov)
```

**Scorecard:**
```
Middlesex Innings - 634/9 (147.4 Ov)
[Batsmen table...]

Gloucestershire Innings - 286/10 (88.1 Ov)
[Batsmen table...]
```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

- [x] Match cards show runs
- [x] Match cards show wickets
- [x] Match cards show overs
- [x] Match details header shows runs
- [x] Match details header shows wickets
- [x] Scorecard innings header shows runs

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT:

### For Vercel:
1. Code is already pushed to GitHub
2. Vercel will auto-deploy
3. **IMPORTANT:** Update RAPIDAPI_KEY environment variable:
   ```
   a2c7e93e5dmsh5aa3e5fe3833633p16893ajsn5987862cca9a
   ```
4. Redeploy with cache OFF
5. Wait 3-4 minutes
6. Test production site

---

## 🆘 IF RUNS STILL DON'T SHOW:

### Check 1: Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for debug logs
- Check if scores are being extracted

### Check 2: Clear Cache
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or open in Incognito mode

### Check 3: Verify Data
```bash
# Check if backend has scores
curl http://localhost:5000/api/matches/recent | grep "runs"

# Should show: "runs": 634, etc.
```

### Check 4: Check Match Status
- Upcoming matches don't show scores (by design)
- Only live and completed matches show scores

---

## 💡 WHY THIS WORKS NOW:

### Before:
- Score extraction had fallback logic but wasn't prioritizing correctly
- No Number() conversion (some values might be strings)
- No debug logging to troubleshoot

### After:
- **Priority 1:** Extract from `teams` array (most reliable)
- **Priority 2:** Extract from `raw.matchScore` (fallback)
- **Priority 3:** Extract from `scorecard` (last resort)
- Number() conversion ensures values are numeric
- Debug logging helps identify issues

---

## 🎉 SUMMARY:

**ALL ISSUES FIXED!**

- ✅ Match cards show runs
- ✅ Match details show runs
- ✅ Scorecard shows runs
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Ready for deployment

**Just update that RAPIDAPI_KEY on Vercel and you're done!** 🏏
