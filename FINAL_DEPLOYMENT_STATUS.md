# 🚀 Final Deployment Status

## ✅ What We Fixed Today

### 1. Scorecard Display Issue
**Problem:** Match details pages showing "0/0" for scores and missing team names in scorecard
**Solution:** Added processing in `matchScorecard.ts` to calculate `totalRuns` and determine `batTeam` for each innings
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed

### 2. Code Deployment
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit: 91a9665)
**Vercel:** Will auto-deploy from GitHub

## 📝 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment (2-3 minutes)
- Check your Vercel dashboard
- Both backend and frontend should auto-deploy

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables in Vercel

#### Frontend Environment Variables
Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Frontend Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Required:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app
```

#### Backend Environment Variables  
Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Backend Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Required:
```
RAPIDAPI_KEY = a2c7e93e5dmsh5aa3e5fe3833633p16893ajsn5987862cca9a
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://Meet:Meet%402701@payload-cluster.ywnbayx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=payload-cluster
RAPIDAPI_HOST = cricbuzz-cricket.p.rapidapi.com
FRONTEND_URL = https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app
PORT = 5000
```

Plus all the RAPIDAPI_*_URL variables (they should already be there)

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment

#### Quick Test URLs:
1. **Homepage:** https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app/
2. **Live Matches:** https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app/formats/live
3. **Match Details:** https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app/matches/113670

#### What to Look For:
- ✅ Matches showing on homepage
- ✅ Live/Recent/Upcoming pages populated
- ✅ Match details showing scores (e.g., "634/9")
- ✅ Scorecard tab displaying properly

## 🔧 If Matches Still Not Showing on Vercel

The most common issue is **missing or incorrect `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** in frontend.

### Quick Fix:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Frontend Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add or update: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app`
3. Redeploy frontend (Vercel will prompt you)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Test again

## 📊 Summary of All Changes Made

### Session 1 (Previous):
- Fixed backend controllers to accept all match types (Domestic, Women, International)
- Fixed frontend score extraction to use teams array
- Updated environment variables
- Fixed CORS configuration

### Session 2 (Today):
- Fixed scorecard data processing to add `batTeam` and `totalRuns` fields
- Deployed the fix to GitHub
- Created deployment documentation

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After deployment completes and environment variables are verified:
- **Locally:** ✅ Already working (you confirmed this)
- **Vercel:** Should work the same way

If it's working locally but not on Vercel, it's 99% an environment variable issue.

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Check environment variables (especially `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
3. Test the URLs above
4. If issues persist, check:
   - Browser console for errors
   - Vercel function logs for backend errors
   - Network tab to see if API calls are being made
