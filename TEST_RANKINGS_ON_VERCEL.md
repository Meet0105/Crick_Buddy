# Test Rankings on Vercel

## Quick Test URLs

Test these URLs directly in your browser to see what the backend is returning:

### Test Bowlers (should show Jasprit Bumrah):
```
https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app/api/rankings/icc-rankings?formatType=test&category=bowlers
```

### ODI Bowlers (should show Keshav Maharaj):
```
https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app/api/rankings/icc-rankings?formatType=odi&category=bowlers
```

### Test Batsmen (should show Joe Root):
```
https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app/api/rankings/icc-rankings?formatType=test&category=batsmen
```

## What to Check:

1. Open each URL in your browser
2. Look at the JSON response
3. Check the `rank` array
4. Look at the first player's `name` field

## Expected Results:

### Test Bowlers:
```json
{
  "rank": [
    {
      "rank": "1",
      "name": "Jasprit Bumrah",  ← Should be a BOWLER
      "country": "India",
      "rating": "889"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ODI Bowlers:
```json
{
  "rank": [
    {
      "rank": "1",
      "name": "Keshav Maharaj",  ← Should be a BOWLER
      "country": "South Africa",
      "rating": "680"
    }
  ]
}
```

## If You See Wrong Data:

### Scenario 1: Backend shows correct data, frontend shows wrong data
**Problem:** Frontend caching or not deployed yet
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh the rankings page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait for frontend deployment to complete
- Clear browser cache

### Scenario 2: Backend shows wrong data (Joe Root in bowlers)
**Problem:** Backend deployment not complete yet
**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Test again after deployment completes

### Scenario 3: Backend returns error
**Problem:** API key or configuration issue
**Solution:**
- Check Vercel environment variables
- Verify RAPIDAPI_KEY is set correctly
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

## Current Status:

✅ Local backend: Working correctly
✅ Code pushed to GitHub: Commit 4a8fda9
⏳ Vercel deployment: In progress (check dashboard)

## Deployment Timeline:

- Code pushed: Just now
- Vercel build time: ~2-3 minutes
- Total wait time: ~3-5 minutes from push

## After Deployment:

1. Test the backend URLs above
2. If backend is correct, test frontend: https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app/rankings
3. Hard refresh if needed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Rankings should show correct data

## Troubleshooting:

If after 5 minutes the data is still wrong:

1. Check Vercel backend deployment logs
2. Check if there are any build errors
3. Verify the latest commit (4a8fda9) is deployed
4. Test the backend URLs directly to isolate the issue
