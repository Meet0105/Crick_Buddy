```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "C:\Codage All Project\cric-app"

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes

```

---

### **STEP 3: Wait for Deployment** (2-3 minutes)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments tab
2. Watch the deployment progress

---

### **STEP 4: Test Your Backend** (1 minute)

Run this command to test:

```bash
curl https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app/api/matches/live
```

**What you should see:**
- ‚úÖ **GOOD:** Array with match objects `[{matchId: "123", teams: [...]}]`
- ‚ùå **BAD:** Empty array `[]` (means env vars not set correctly)

**Or use the test script:**

```bash
node test-backend.js
```

---

### **STEP 5: Check Your Frontend** (1 minute)

1. Visit: https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app
2. You should now see:
   - ‚úÖ Match cards with team names
   - ‚úÖ Scores displayed
   - ‚úÖ Live indicators
   - ‚úÖ Click on a match ‚Üí details load

## üéØ Quick Visual Guide

### Before Fix:
```
Frontend: "No matches available" üòû
Backend API: [] (empty array)
```

### After Fix:
```
Frontend: Match cards with scores! üéâ
Backend API: [{matchId: "123", teams: [...], scores: [...]}]
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing empty arrays after deployment

2. Make sure you selected all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Redeploy: Go to Deployments ‚Üí Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Test again

### Issue: "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error

**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs https://crick-buddy-backend-v.vercel.app`
2. Look for MongoDB connection errors
3. Verify MongoDB Atlas allows connections from 0.0.0.0/0

### Issue: CORS errors in browser

**Solution:**
1. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable is set
2. Check it matches your actual frontend URL
3. Redeploy backend
