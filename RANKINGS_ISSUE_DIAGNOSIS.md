# Rankings Issue Diagnosis

## Current Status

### Backend (Local):
✅ **Working perfectly** - Returns correct data for all categories
- Test Batsmen: Joe Root, Harry Brook, Kane Williamson
- Test Bowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Kagiso Rabada, Matt Henry
- ODI Batsmen: Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma, Babar Azam
- ODI Bowlers: Keshav Maharaj, Maheesh Theekshana, Jofra Archer

### Frontend (Local):
❌ **Shows "Currently data is syncing"** - This means rankings array is empty

### Frontend (Vercel):
❌ **Shows old fallback data** - Joe Root everywhere

## Root Cause

The frontend is NOT successfully calling the backend API, or the API calls are failing.

## Why "Currently data is syncing" appears:

This message appears when `rankings.length === 0` in the `PlayerRankingsTable` component.

This happens when:
1. API call fails (network error, CORS, timeout)
2. API returns empty data
3. Frontend can't reach backend

## Checklist to Fix:

### 1. Is Frontend Running?
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Should be running on http://localhost:3000

### 2. Is Backend Running?
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Should be running on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Check Frontend Environment Variable
File: `frontend/.env` or `frontend/.env.local`

Should have:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

If this file doesn't exist or has wrong URL, frontend can't reach backend!

### 4. Check Browser Console
1. Open http://localhost:3000/rankings
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for errors like:
   - "Failed to fetch"
   - "Network error"
   - "CORS error"
   - "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

### 5. Check Network Tab
1. In DevTools, go to Network tab
2. Refresh the rankings page
3. Look for API calls to `/api/rankings/icc-rankings`
4. Check if they're:
   - Being made at all
   - Succeeding (status 200)
   - Returning data

## Most Likely Issues:

### Issue 1: Frontend Not Running
**Symptom:** Can't access http://localhost:3000
**Solution:** Start frontend with `npm run dev` in frontend folder

### Issue 2: Wrong API URL
**Symptom:** Network errors in console
**Solution:** Create/update `frontend/.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
Then restart frontend

### Issue 3: CORS Error
**Symptom:** CORS error in console
**Solution:** Backend should already have CORS configured, but verify `backend/src/server.ts` has:
```typescript
app.use(cors());
```

### Issue 4: Backend Not Running
**Symptom:** Connection refused errors
**Solution:** Start backend with `npm run dev` in backend folder

## For Vercel:

The Vercel issue is different - it's showing OLD data because:
1. Deployment hasn't completed
2. Or deployment failed
3. Or wrong branch deployed

**Solution for Vercel:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Check backend deployment status
3. Look for commit `1e02410` or `4a8fda9`
4. If not there, manually redeploy
5. Check build logs for errors

## Quick Test:

Run this in your browser console while on the rankings page:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/rankings/icc-rankings?formatType=test&category=batsmen')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Backend response:', d))
  .catch(e => console.error('Error:', e));
```

If this works, backend is fine. If it fails, there's a connection issue.

## Next Steps:

1. Verify both frontend and backend are running locally
2. Check frontend `.env.local` file exists with correct API URL
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test the fetch command above
5. Share any error messages you see
