# ✅ Scorecard Runs Display Fix

## Problem
Scorecard innings headers were showing "0/10 (62.5 Ov)" instead of the actual runs like "230/10 (62.5 Ov)".
- Wickets: ✅ Showing correctly
- Overs: ✅ Showing correctly  
- Runs: ❌ Showing as 0

## Root Cause
The `innings.totalRuns` field was not always present in the scorecard data, and there was no fallback calculation.

## Solution
Added automatic calculation in `MatchScorecard.tsx` component:
- If `totalRuns` is 0 or missing, calculate it from batsmen runs + extras
- Formula: `totalRuns = sum(all batsmen runs) + extras.total`

## Changes Made
**File:** `frontend/components/MatchScorecard.tsx`

Added calculation logic in two places:
1. Regular scorecard format (when `innings.batsman` exists)
2. Fallback format (when other fields exist)

```typescript
// If totalRuns is still 0, calculate it from batsmen + extras
if (totalRuns === 0 && batsmen.length > 0) {
  const batsmenRuns = batsmen.reduce((sum, batsman) => {
    const runs = batsman.runs || 0;
    return sum + runs;
  }, 0);
  const extrasTotal = extras.total || 0;
  totalRuns = batsmenRuns + extrasTotal;
}
```

## Testing
✅ Tested calculation logic with sample data
✅ Verified: 212 (batsmen) + 18 (extras) = 230 total runs

## Deployment
✅ Committed: adf421c
✅ Pushed to GitHub
✅ Vercel will auto-deploy frontend

## Expected Result
After deployment, scorecard headers will show:
```
Western Australia Innings - 230/10 (62.5 Ov)
```

Instead of:
```
Western Australia Innings - 0/10 (62.5 Ov)
```

## Important Notes
- ✅ Match cards still work correctly (no changes made)
- ✅ Match details header still works correctly (no changes made)
- ✅ Only fixed the scorecard innings header display
- ✅ This is a frontend-only fix, no backend changes needed

## Wait Time
- Vercel deployment: 2-3 minutes
- Then test at: https://crick-buddy-frontend-v.vercel.app/matches/[matchId]
- Click on "Scorecard" tab to see the fix

## Verification
After deployment, check any match with scorecard data:
1. Go to match details page
2. Click "Scorecard" tab
3. Verify innings headers show actual runs (not 0)
